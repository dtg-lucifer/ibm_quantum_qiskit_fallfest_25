# Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 - IISER Kolkata

This repository contains my learning materials, code notebooks, and
implementations from the **Qiskit Fall Fest 2025** workshop hosted by **IISER
Kolkata**.

## 📚 About the Workshop

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a **3-day intensive workshop** focused on quantum
computing using IBM's Qiskit framework. The workshop bridges the gap between
theoretical quantum computing concepts and their practical implementation in
Python.

### Workshop Objectives

- Learn the fundamentals of quantum computing
- Implement theoretical quantum computations using Qiskit
- Understand quantum gates, circuits, and algorithms
- Gain hands-on experience with quantum simulators and real quantum hardware

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtg-lucifer/ibm_quantum_qiskit_fallfest_25.git
cd ibm_quantum_qiskit_fallfest_25
```

2. Install dependencies for each day:

**For Day 0:**

```bash
cd day0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For Day 1:**

```bash
cd day1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with `day0/installation_01.ipynb` to set up your environment
2. Progress through each day's notebooks in order
3. Complete the exercises in each notebook
4. Experiment with the code and modify circuits to deepen your understanding

## 📝 Notes

- Each day's folder contains its own `requirements.txt` file with specific
  dependencies
- Notebooks include exercises to practice the concepts learned
- Code examples demonstrate practical implementations of quantum computing
  concepts
- Visualizations help understand quantum states and circuit behavior
